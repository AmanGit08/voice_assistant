# Text-to-Speech AI Bot

## Overview
This project is a powerful Text-to-Speech (TTS) AI bot implemented in Python. It leverages modern machine learning techniques to convert text input into human-like spoken audio. The bot can be used for various applications such as assisting visually impaired users, enhancing digital communication, and creating audiobooks.

## Features
- **High-Quality Voice Output**: Generates natural-sounding speech using advanced deep learning models.
- **Language Support**: Supports multiple languages and dialects.
- **Customizable Voice Profiles**: Users can choose different voice profiles according to preference.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API that allows integration with other applications and services.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Quickly convert text to speech without noticeable delays.

## Installation
To install the necessary dependencies, use pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To run the bot, execute the following command:
```bash
python tts_bot.py
```

### Example Input
```python
text = "Hello, welcome to the Text-to-Speech bot!"
```

### Example Output
The bot will generate an audio file (e.g., `output.mp3`) that reads the text aloud.
